learning abm modeling
5 basic lessons about the attributes and properties of complex system.
this  is very basic use of github platform.
currently used as a driver more than a code editor.
this lessons is self learning integration of investigation and experimentation in a very basic level.
the netlogo models are from the netlogo librery
[except  two or three that are retrived from complexity explorer https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses/74-introduction-to-complexity-spring-2017]
each lesson constructed of three parts. first, intruduction with basic model-samples ,not 
computrised models. second, is investigation of netlogo models with some guiding quetions. third part is learning the basic ideas of net logo and netlogo langeuge
############
some of the quetion is for research and the student asked to send them by third-party platform cold jotform
#######
this is not the last eddition
i hope this versions of lessons will branched and become more refined in the future
